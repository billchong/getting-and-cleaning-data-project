# getting-and-cleaning-data-project
Project submission for getting and cleaning data

## Overview
This is Bill Chong's repo for the John Hopkins "Getting and Cleaning Data" project. The data used on the project was obtained from the following link: (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). A full description of the data can be found at the website.

## Project Requirements
A single R script file run_analysis.R is executed on the data set and completely builds the tidy data set. The output generated by the script file is written to the file tidydata.txt using the R command with write.table with row.name equals FALSE. The file is located at the same location where run_analysis was executed

## Additional Information
Details of data transformations and variables can be found in Codebook.MD

# getting-and-cleaning-data-project
Project submission for getting and cleaning data

## Overview
This is Bill Chong's repo for the John Hopkins "Getting and Cleaning Data" project. The data used on the project was obtained from the following link: (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). A full description of the data can be found at the website.

## Project Requirements
A single R script file run_analysis.R is executed on the data set and completely builds the tidy data set from the UCS HAR data files. The output generated by the script file is written to the file tidydata.txt which is located at the same location where run_analysis was executed.

## Instructions to execute run_analysis.R
The script file run_analysis.R should be executed in the same directory as the unzipped data set. The working directory should be changed to reflect the current working directory.

## Additional Information
Details of data transformations and variables can be found in Codebook.MD
